# Eligere

Eligere is a software intended as a contribution to digital democracy community in the belief that voting software should be open source. The software in this repo has been already used for casting more than eight thousand votes in University elections.

The software has been initially inspired as a web interface to use [ElectionGuard](https://github.com/Microsoft/ElectionGuard) SDK for implementing secure ballot boxes. The project has deviated into a system to support the full election process including the formation of electoral lists.

The codebase still needs heavy polishing and not all the features are yet exposed through the web interface.

We will keep updating this repository to make this project a successful contribution to an open democratic process.
